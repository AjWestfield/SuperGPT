## ‚è™ How to Revert

To revert to this exact working version:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AjWestfield/SuperGPT.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd SuperGPT

# Checkout the tagged version
git checkout websearch-and-openai-working

# Copy environment template
cp .env.local.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local with your API keys:
# - OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
# - TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key (though SearXNG is configured as primary)

# Configure SearXNG settings in .env.local:
# - SEARCH_API=searxng
# - SEARXNG_SECRET=generate_a_secret_with_openssl_rand_-base64_32
# - Other SearXNG settings are pre-configured

# Start Docker containers for Redis and SearXNG
docker compose up -d

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start the application
bun dev
```

The application should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (or next available port).

## üåê Deploy

Host your own live version of SuperGPT with Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or Docker.

### Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FAjWestfield%2FSuperGPT)

When deploying to Vercel, ensure that:
1. Your API keys are added to environment variables
2. For SearXNG, either configure a publicly accessible SearXNG instance or switch to Tavily

### Docker

For Docker deployment, use the included docker-compose.yaml file:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the Redis and SearXNG containers. The SearXNG settings are already configured in the .env.local file.
